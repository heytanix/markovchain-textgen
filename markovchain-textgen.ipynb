    "* `random`: This library is essential for the text generation phase. When a word has multiple possible words that can follow it, `random.choice()` will help us pick one at random.\n",
    "* `collections.defaultdict`: This is a specialized dictionary. It simplifies our code by automatically creating a default value (in our case, an empty list) for any key that we try to access but doesn't exist yet. This is perfect for adding new words to our chain."
